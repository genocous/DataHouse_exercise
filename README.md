This program takes in an input of JSON data with names and a list of attributes. The attributes being analyzed are intelligence, strength, endurance, and spicyFoodTolerance. The goal is to find out how compatible applicants to a certain company are to current team members of that company. The initial data given are the names and attributes of 3 team members and 3 applicants. The compatibility scores were calculated using the Euclidean distance formula, treating the list of attribute values as a vector. The calculation is (1 - (min_score/max_score)) in order to set 1 as the best value (most compatible), and 0 as the worst value (least compatible).  

Additionally, I created two more functions which calculated individual compatibility scores between each team member and each applicant. I put those scores into a pandas DataFrame, and created a visualization showing how compatible each applicant is with each team member. 

The final output is JSON data with names and compatibility scores for the whole team, plus the visualization of individuals.
